reflections on rhetoric
-----------------------

**Prompt:** For each of the two authors you select, reflect on their ideas and their messages. What is the most significant idea you can borrow from them that you can apply to your own portfolio? Make your responses as specific as you can.

**Response:** Jonathan Corum (whale dive and feed)

Corum's graphic on the whale dive and feed is very powerful to me because it displays a lot of data while still being instantly understandable and clear. The use of the three graphs on top of each other (Depth, fluking pattern, and speed) lets me easily understand what is going on without needing multiple scales. The way all the data sets are structured by the amount of time into the dive is very useful for making the display intuitive. I also like the use of the whale for scale, the explanatory text, and the graphics showing what the whale looks like at each stage in it's lunge.

For my graphs the two main things I can see myself using are the explanatory text, and the relation of several sets of data through one key scale. Not all data sets can be displayed in the way Corum has done but with each set of data I will think about if I can relate everything so intuitively.

**Response:** David McCandless (the billion-dollar-o-gram)

The most striking thing about McCandless' display is the relative size difference between the different boxes. I am very used to using a log scale or otherwise reorganizing data when multiple values are so different in scale, but by not doing that McCandless creates a much more powerful display. It is easy to look at and simply picture some boxes fitting into others, putting the various budgets and costs into terms that are more understandable. In my graphs I will think more about when a truncated scale is necessary, and when a display would be more powerful without one.
