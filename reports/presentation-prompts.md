D1 box plot
-----------

State the number of observations: 5,854

List the variables:

variable name: Country

-   type: Categorical, nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 234

variable name: Type of good

-   type: Categorical, nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 29

variable name: Trade balance

-   type: quantitative, discrete

State the graph type: Box plot

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:

-   There is only one quantitative variable and a number of categorical (or categorical levels) (it is univariate)
-   There are far too many observations to be distinsguishable in a dot plot, so a box plot is better
-   My goal is to compare several distributions with large data sets, and several box plots on the same graph work well for this purpose (Doumont, [2009](#ref-Doumont:2009))

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference

-   I put the commodities on the y-axis, so they could be easily read, which was more important then easily reading labeled data points. (Doumont, [2009](#ref-Doumont:2009))
-   I made the graph very large so it could accomidate the labeling I wanted. (Doumont, [2009](#ref-Doumont:2009))
-   I jittered th outliers and made them translucent so that they can all be seen. (Robbins, [2013](#ref-Robbins:2013a))
-   I only labeled a few key outliers because labeling too many of them would cause the data to become unreadible. (Robbins, [2013](#ref-Robbins:2013a))
-   I ordered the data by its mean, going from highest to lowest.This makes it easier to pick out discrepencies between the data sets.
-   I used a cubic scale to serve the same purpose as a log scale, but It also works for negative numbers

Comments from peers

-   write deficiet / surplus directly on chart
-   use a linear scale to better focus on outliers
-   sort by absolute value of max min / or standary deviation
-   work in vertical and only flip at end

D2 multiway
-----------

State the number of observations: 100

List the variables:

Variable name: Number of Indidents

-   type: Quantitative, discrete

variable name: Category of Indident

-   type: Categorical, nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 25

variable name: Time of day

-   type: Categorical, Ordinal
-   levels (if categorical): 4

State the graph type: Multiway

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:

-   I have a quantitative result for every combination of levels from the two categories
-   I want to make comparisons between the two categories and within their levels

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference

-   choice, reference
-   choice, reference
-   etc

(Doumont, [2009](#ref-Doumont:2009)) (Robbins, [2013](#ref-Robbins:2013a)) (Wainer, [2014](#ref-Wainer:2014))
