------

Tufte, Edward (1997) The decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger. In: *Visual and statistical thinking: Displays of evidence for making decisions.* Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 16--31.

**Prompt:** Tufte says, "Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of the accident, there was a clear proximate cause." Summarize Tufte's explanation of the proximate cause.

**Response:** The link between cold tempertature and O-ring damage was not properly shown in the Thiokol presentation to NASA.The engineers' arguments to halt the launch were not convincing.

**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those ideas.

**Response:** None of the 13 charts that Thiokol used contained both temperature and (some measure of) O-ring damage together. Only the rockets that had O-ring damage were considered; the majority of rockets had no damage, and including them would have shown more clearly the relationship between low temperature and O-ring damage. In terms of credibility the charts lacked proper documentation and have irrelevent data mixed in (e.g. Nozze Blow-By). Several different names for the same rockets

**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What data were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in making the launch decision?

**Response:** The erosion, Blow-By history, and temperture of O-rings for 6 rockets, 4 of which were only horizontal tests for development rockets. All rockets had O-ring damage. They had 17 launches (with no damage) which should have been included according to Tufte.

**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual evidence that the "launch was completely outside the engineering database accumulated in 24 previous flight." Describe the structure of this data set:

-   Number of observations
-   Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of levels).

**Response:** N = 24 observations (the Challenger launch would be 25). However one obsevation lacks a damage index, as the O-ring was lost at sea. Temperature is quantitative continuous. Damage index is quantitative discrete.

**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.

**Response:** The Challenger launch could have been prevented had the engineers who presented the argument to do so properly shown the link between cold temperature and O-ring damage with effective data analysis and displays.

**Visual Rhetoric:** Damage should be displayed with a number, not cross hatching to be easy to see. Data should be ordered by size, not date or alphebetically.

week 4 reading prompts

Wainer, Howard (2014) Fifteen displays about one thing. In: *Medical illuminations: Using evidence, visualization, and statistical thinking to improve healthcare.* UK: Oxford University Press, 32--49.

Definition: "Gram staining" (named after its inventor, the Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram) is a method of staining to distinguish one type of bacterium from another---it can be used as a faster substitute for culturing. Gram staining is a category with two levels: some bacteria are Gram stain negative and some are Gram stain positive. Read more about it on the
[Gram stain Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_stain).

**Prompt:** Reviewing the article carefully, come up with a list of variables. Classify each as quantitative or categorical, and if categorical, the levels.

**Response:**

variable name: Antibiotics

-   type: Categorical, nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 3

variable name: Bacteria

-   type: Catergorical, nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 16

variable name: gram-pole

-   type: Catergorical, ordinal
-   levels (if categorical): 2

variable name: Minimum inhibitory concentration

-   type: Quantitative, continuous

**Prompt:** The article title is "Fifteen displays about one thing." After reading the entire article, what is the "one thing?" Note that the "one thing" might imply multiple goals or more than one question.

**Response:** If you get a certain gram-staining result, what antibacteria should you use? What is the difference in effectiveness of the different antibacterias with different bacteria?

**Prompt:** In your opinion, which of the 15 displays best answers the question(s) about the "one thing?"

**Response:** Entry 13, Polygons

**Prompt:** Explain why.

**Response:** It most clearly shows which antibiotic should be used in which case without oversimplifying the data (as in entry 2). By seperating the gram positive and negative into two graphs it is easier to see what is going on than in the line graphs (entry 9, and 10). The log scale is explicated and it is easy to see the relative difference in effectiveness between two antibiotics for the same bacteria.

**Prompt:** Re-read Wainer's conclusion section. What main points does he make about graph design or visual rhetoric that you could apply to your own work this term.

**Response:** It is often good to have a question or questions in mind when making a chart that is supposed to be evidence of something. However making a more general graph to discover a question can also be a good strategy. For a given data set and question their are likely multiple good ways of making a chart, so don't just make one design then stop.

week 6 reading prompts
----------------------

Dragga, Sam & Dan Voss (2001) Cruel pies: The inhumanity of technical illustrations. *Technical Communication* 48(3): 265--274.

**Prompt:** Explain how the prevalent treatment of ethics in visual communication is lacking.

**Response:** According to Voss and Draga, while most experts in visual communication do a good job in teaching how to create efficient and truthful displays, they ignore the possible harm that can come from purely technical display about human suffering. This is because much of the foundation for the discipline of visual communication has come from the sciences, rather than more humanistic fields.

**Prompt:** Explain the purpose of "humanizing" data displays depicting human suffering or death.

**Response:** By humanizing a display of data (through adding human images or context) the display can be made more sensitive, and potentially less painful to those who view it. In particular people who are victims of the suffering shown by the display would benefit the most from that sort of modification.

**Prompt:** Consider the authors' attempts at redesigning such data displays. Did one in particular strike you as ineffective? Explain

**Response:** Figures 10 and 11 (bed fire abd baby walker) both struck me as worse than the originals. By simply adding some sort of stock image / cartoon to the display they seem to trivialize the suffering, which is much worse than just being insensitive.

**Prompt:** Did one in particular strike you as effective? Explain.

**Response:** Figure 7 (Napoleon) worked well. The use of symbolic pictographs was a good choice, giving a human element without the trivial feeling of a stock photograph or cartoon. The display of the different kinds of soldiers was good (the horesmen, cannons, riflemen, etc) because it broke down the amorphus idea of the "army" into human individuals.

reflections on rhetoric: graphical lies
---------------------------------------

-   Describe the author's idea or ideas that you found most memorable.
-   Discuss how you will apply the idea(s) to one of your designs

<br> **Reading:** How to display data badly (Wainer, 2000)

**Response:** The graph of the docters salary vs other professionals was powerful. I had never considered changing time (in years) to a non-linear scale. It is extemely misleading and not easily noticeable. I will make sure with my displays to be careful about changing the time scale to something non-linear. In the vast majority of situation it would be more misleading than helpful.

<br> **Video:** [How charts lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd046xZhO_8&t=21m29s) by Alberto Cairo

**Response:** Cairo's point on using the wrong data was particularly memerable for me. This is something I see a lot, the use of very specific metrics to tell a desired story or the use discedited sources. It is one of the hardest bad graph types to debunk. However it seems generally easy to avoid. You will only use those very specific metrics if you spent a long time searching for them, for most topics it is easy to find reputable sources. So, as long as I remeber to avoid disreputable sources and data mining I should be fine.

Kostelnick reading in class notes, and response
-----------------------------------------------

rhetorics: science, adaptation, participation, social. science: singe logical truth. social: people's backgrounds affect how they view it. adaptation: the context of the raph affects how people view it. participation: people change the way the data is presented.

In summary, the main point of the Kostelnick paper is that the rhetoric of science is not the only valid rhetoric. In order for others to find a graphical display convincing (and even clear) it needs to be designed with the audience, time and location of use, and various other aspects in mind.

For my graphs, if I use them outside of this course, it will almost certainly be in a context of people who are highly invested in the rhetoric of science (engineers, scientists). So, the natural thing for me to do-design the displays according to the rhetoric of science-would also coinicidentally be the most effective thing for me to do. Without knowledge of some other specific audience (and time & place) I would show the display to I can't learn their specific rhetoric. The time and location invarient nature of the rhetoric of science (or its attempt to reach that ideal) seems to mean that if I do not know the specific future use of my display it would be best to stay within the more general, if less convincing/clear to some, rhetoric of science.

week 10 reading prompts
-----------------------

Spence, Ian (2006) William Playfair and the psychology of graphs. In: *IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication.* Alexandria, VA: American Statistical Association, section on statistical graphics, 2426--2436.

<br> **Prompt:** Explain what the author means by the "psychology of graphs."

**Response:** The psychological mechanisims behind sight affects how people read graphs. If graphs take this into account it helps people to undersand the graphs more fully and quickly. For example, human short term visual memory is limited to only a few objects, so graphs should limit the number of elements a person has to pay attention to.

<br> **Prompt:** Psychology was identified as its own science in the 1730s and experimental psychology research began in the 1830s. Thus William Playfair's life (1759--1823) overlapped the beginnings of psychology as a science. But he was not a psychologist---he was a craftsman by trade who was exposed to the best minds of the Scottish Enlightenment. His experience included engineering, commerce, and publishing (as well as dubious investment schemes and attempted extortion). Nevertheless, the author makes connections between Playfair and psychology.

Describe those connections.

**Response:** Playfairs interactions withe Dugald Stewart and Thomas reid (early psychologists) influenced him. He also drafted for James Watt, giving him some experiance with making human readable diagrams. Maps, over time, had through trial and error become more compatible with human psychology. So Playfairs experiance with cartography allowed him to take those lessons and apply them to graphs. For example, Playfair realized People are good at comparing lengths, so length is a good element to reprsent quantiy. People can easily distinguish distinct colors, so color is a good element to represent category.

<br> **Prompt:** In section 2.3, the author describes 5 examples of graphical conventions that Playfair invented or adapted. Discuss your interpretation of each convention in light of our other readings and discussions this term.

**Response:** Color: The use of color to color to distinguish category makes me think of Tuftes "comparison" style of graph. Color is definitly better used on the categorical side of things than quantitative.

slope: the use of slope to represent trends seems so natural (from calculus) that it seems hard to imagine doing it any other way. Playfair seemed very focused on evolution over time, and slope comes very naturally out of those sort of graphs.

length: The psychological background behind the use of length to code quantity makes it obvious why a bar char that doesn't start at zero is a lie. the point of using length is that people can easily compare length and therefore don't need another element (a axis or label) to see the diferences between categories, this no longer works with a non zero base.

area: In general graph designers today are against the use area to code quantity. looking at Playfairs graph it just seems harder to see trends and precise differences in size.

subdividing the cirle (pie): This suffers similar problems as using area to encode quantity.
