## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##  try writing an equation 


$$
m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F
$$

## Citations 

Visualization is a great place to start with R programming, because the payoff is 
so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that help you understand 
data [@Wickham+Grolemund:2017]. 


If you are trying to show a a correlation or causaul relationship between two variables you should have them on the same display [@Tufte:1997].
