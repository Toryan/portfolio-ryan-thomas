## Reading responses 

## week 2

Tufte, Edward (1997) The decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger.
In: *Visual and statistical thinking: Displays of evidence for making
decisions.* Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 16--31.

**Prompt:** Tufte says, "Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of the
accident, there was a clear proximate cause." Summarize Tufte's explanation 
of the proximate cause.  

**Response:** The link between cold tempertature and O-ring damage was not properly shown in the Thiokol presentation to NASA.The engineers' arguments to halt the launch were not convincing.


**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those ideas.

**Response:** None of the 13 charts that Thiokol used contained both temperature and (some measure of) O-ring damage together. Only the rockets that had O-ring damage were considered; the majority of rockets had no damage, and including them would have shown more clearly the relationship between low temperature and O-ring damage. In terms of credibility the charts lacked proper documentation and have irrelevent data mixed in (e.g. Nozze Blow-By). Several different names for the same rockets


**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What data 
were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in making the
launch decision?

**Response:** The erosion, Blow-By history, and temperture of O-rings for 6 rockets, 4 of which were only horizontal
tests for development rockets. All rockets had O-ring damage. They had 17 launches (with no damage) which should have been included according to Tufte.


**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual evidence
that the "launch was completely outside the engineering database accumulated 
in 24 previous flight." Describe the structure of this data set:

- Number of observations 
- Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of levels). 

**Response:** N = 24 observations (the Challenger launch would be 25). However one obsevation lacks a damage index, as the O-ring was lost at sea. Temperature is quantitative continuous. Damage index is quantitative discrete.


**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.  

**Response:** The Challenger launch could have been prevented had the engineers who presented the argument to do so properly shown the link between cold temperature and O-ring damage with effective data analysis and displays.

**Visual Rhetoric:** Damage should be displayed with a number, not cross hatching to be easy to see. Data should be ordered by size, not date or alphebetically.
