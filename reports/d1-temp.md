R Markdown
----------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

try writing an equation
-----------------------

![
m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + kx = F
](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Am%5Cddot%7Bx%7D%20%2B%20c%5Cdot%7Bx%7D%20%2B%20kx%20%3D%20F%0A "
m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F
")

Citations
---------

Visualization is a great place to start with R programming, because the payoff is so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that help you understand data (Wickham and Grolemund, [2017](#ref-Wickham+Grolemund:2017)).

If you are trying to show a a correlation or causaul relationship between two variables you should have them on the same display (Tufte, [1997](#ref-Tufte:1997)).
