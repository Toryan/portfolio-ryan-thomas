Redesigning a misleading political graph

### Report

The subreddit r/dataisbeautiful is the forum on reddit dedicated to data vizualization. Unfortunately due to the popularity contest nature of the subreddit occasionally displays that are pandering and misleading are highly ranked. The following is one such graph, which panders to the left wing / any-lobbying crowd.

This graph is flawed in several ways. In order to pander to a specific audience it limits the data shown to one political party and one voting pattern. It suggests a correlation (between money donated and voting yes) where there is none (when the full context is included). Without anything to compare the raw numbers against the data that is displayed is meaningless.
Beyond being misleading it is also poorly made. The bar chart is a poor choice, and the bars are not ordered by the data.

I have made several alterations to imrove the display:
